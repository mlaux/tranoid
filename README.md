This is a playable version of the BGA from the beatmania IIDX song [TRANOID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rSeU75edBk), ported to the NES/Famicom with NESFab. The port includes a couple extra features not shown in the original video, like 2-player mode and scorekeeping. 

## Controls

* Start button to start
* D-pad to move

## Play options

* Hold B while starting to select R-RANDOM.
* Hold Select while starting to select the ANOTHER CHART... how far can you get?

## Compiling

The only requirement is having NESFab installed in `../nesfab/`. Just clone the repo and run `./compile.sh`. I used NESFab 1.5 to develop this, but other versions might work.

## Real hardware

Here it is running on my Twin Famicom.
